# store-products
This project is an updated version of a previous project. It's made to help my mother and brothers keep track of the prices of the products we sell in a little store my mother owns.
This project was done using html, css and javascript. I used firebase realtime database because it's easier and faster. While, allowing me to implement a database with my small skills in JavaScript. I dont know when I'll add an updated version (probably when I learn node.js) but I will not delete nor modify completeley this version because it's a have to prove that we can all get better by practicing.
